[X] Clean SSD300 model to use proper naming conventions.
[X] Evaluate refactored model.
[ ] Check if the sequence_manager can be used with the experimental_loss.
[ ] Refactor image generator to be instantiate without validation data.

BUG:
Evaluation script might be incorrect when loading their RGB values differently

Refactor create_prior_boxes
4*38*38 + 19*19*6 + 10*10*6 + 5*5*6 + 3*3*4 + 1*1*4

In every coordinate of the input feature map, we predict 4 bounding boxes (possibly with different aspect ratios)
for each class and then for each coordinate.

Add visualization script for the data augmentation pipeline
Fix API with dataset manager to take a dictionary with dataset_name:split
Fix API to return validation data with its corresponding split as well
check how load only set of weights and not initialize the network with all pre-trained weights

Clean pytorch utils
Clean evaluation code
Add training script
Clean loss function
Test training script
Add again image demo
